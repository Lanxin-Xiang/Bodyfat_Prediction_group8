# Bodyfat_Prediction_group8
STAT 628, module 2, Bodyfat_Prediction_group8
Goal

In this project, our group will come up with a simple, robust, and accurate “rule-of-thumb” to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurements.
Our “rule-of-thumb” will be based on a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.
